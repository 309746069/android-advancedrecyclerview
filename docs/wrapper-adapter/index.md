The `WrapperAdapter` is a wrapper of another adapter(s). This is a core mechanism of Advanced RecyclerView library. Drag & Drop, Swipe, Expand, Headers and Footers, etc... major features of this library are using it. We can implement additional functionalities by using [Decorator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) through the mechanism.
